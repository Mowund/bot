# Mowund Bot Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** July 18, 2024

This document pertains to the Discord bots **Mowund#3410** and **Mowund Beta#4816**.

## 1. Introduction and Agreement

These Terms of Service, along with our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Mowund/Bot/blob/dev/PRIVACY.md), constitute a legal agreement between Mowund ("we", "us", "our") and you ("you" or "your"). By using our services, you confirm that you are at least 13 years old and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Bots.

## 2. Usage and Compliance

You must not use the Bots to violate any laws, Discord’s [Terms of Services](https://discord.com/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). Additionally, you must not use the Bots for harmful activities such as spamming or harassment, or automate your usage of the Bots. By using our services, you agree to these conditions unless you have prior written permission from us.

## 3. Changes to Terms

We may update or change these Terms at any time without prior notice (though we usually announce changes in our Discord). Changes take effect seven (7) days after posting on the service (e.g., the bot's website or Discord server). Continued use of the Bots after the effective date means you accept the new Terms. If you disagree with any changes, your only option is to stop using the Bots.

## 4. Rights and Restrictions

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and access the Bots for personal, non-commercial use. You agree not to:

- Use the Bots for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by these Terms.
- Copy, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, or otherwise exploit the Bots or any part of them.
- Use the Bots in any way that violates laws, rules, or regulations or infringes on the rights of any third party.
- Spam messages that trigger the Bots, regardless of guild rules.
- Abuse, exploit, or misuse the Bots.
- Use the Bots to post NSFW content in areas where age verification is not required.
- Violate the personal, intellectual property, or other rights of any party, including using, uploading, transmitting, or distributing information that infringes on these rights through the Bots.
- Send unsolicited marketing messages or broadcasts (i.e., spam) or violate the Terms of Service of any chat or social platform.

## 5. Branding

The Bots' branding (e.g., our logo, with or without the "Mowund" name) must not be used in a way that harms the brand, such as deceiving users or causing harm to others.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SERVICES AND MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. WHILE WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR DATA, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR MATERIALS ACCESSED THROUGH OR DOWNLOADED FROM THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO SOME DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR USER CONTENT, INCLUDING YOUR CONTENT, OR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY, AND THAT THE RISK OF HARM OR DAMAGE FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.

## 8. Indemnification

YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD US HARMLESS FROM ANY LOSS, LIABILITY, CLAIM, DEMAND, DAMAGES, COSTS, AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH a) YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO THE SERVICE; b) YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY TERM OF THESE TERMS; c) YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHT, INCLUDING COPYRIGHT, PROPERTY, OR PRIVACY RIGHTS; OR d) ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU POST OR SHARE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE. "YOU" INCLUDES ANYONE ACCESSING THE SERVICE USING YOUR ACCOUNT.
